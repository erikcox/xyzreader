### User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
**Lyla says:**

*“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”*

*“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."*

**Kagure says:**

*“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”*
